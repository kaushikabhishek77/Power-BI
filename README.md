## Analysis of ShopNest Store Sales Data

In this project, I have created a sales dashboard using Power BI. The data is of a Portuguese e-commerce marketplace company - ShopNest. Serving as a seamless link, it connects small businesses from various regions in Portugal to channels, streamlining the process with a single point of contact. Through the ShopNest Store, these merchants can showcase and sell their products, with the added convenience of direct shipment to customers facilitated by ShopNest logistics partners. The provided data represents authentic commercial information that has undergone the process of anonymization.

The following analytical questions are answered by this dashboard:

> Top 10 Product Categories by Total Sales  
> Number of delayed orders in each category  
> Monthly comparison of delayed and on-time orders  
> Top 10 highest-rated and Bottom 10 lowest-rated products  
> State-wise Sales Analysis  
> Seasonal Sales Patterns  
> Revenue Analysis
