Analysis of ShopNest Store Sales Data

In this project, I have created a sales dashboard using Power BI. The data is of a Portuguese e-commerce marketplace company - ShopNest. Serving as a seamless link, it connects small businesses from various regions in Portugal to channels, streamlining the process with a single point of contact. Through the ShopNest Store, these merchants can showcase and sell their products, with the added convenience of direct shipment to customers facilitated by ShopNest logistics partners. The provided data represents authentic commercial information that has undergone the process of anonymization.
